# QuantFundAgent

Master's thesis project (Mathematics & Finance, Imperial College London).

## Goal
Build LLM agents that operate like a professional quant fund: researching
features, designing strategies, and deploying them live.

## Architecture
A LangGraph multi-agent pipeline mirroring a quant fund's org chart:

- **Factor Researcher** – reads papers, brainstorms alpha ideas, generates
  factor code, keeps the ones that pass an IC backtest.
- **Selector** – picks factors for a hypothesis.
- **Architect** – combines factors into a strategy via a refinement loop.
- **Statistician** – OOS tests, deflated Sharpe, accept/reject gate.
- **Portfolio Manager** – screens, allocates capital, monitors/retires
  strategies (single PM or a committee).

State flows through shared databases (factor / paper / strategy / portfolio).
The stage sequence lives in `quant_fund_agent/pipeline.py` so the notebook,
scripts, and backtests all drive the agents identically.

## Status
A working **MVP** of the full pipeline exists. Each stage and agent is
intended to be advanced significantly in future work.

## Roadmap
- Longer backtests: simulate weekly researcher updates and trade over an
  extended period (the `pipeline.py` stages are built to be called on a
  schedule).
- Deepen the sophistication of every agent.

## Conventions
- Use Anthropic's MCP for agent/tool interactions.

## Python Environment
Always use the local virtual environment interpreter directly.
- Run python scripts: `./venv/bin/python path/to/script.py`
- Run tests: `./venv/bin/pytest`
- Install packages: `./venv/bin/pip install <package>`
